      "description": "Now, when we look at today's world, migration is a constant ongoing human phenomenon for so many reasons. So many people in our world today, almost all of us, no longer live our lives close to where we call home, not as before. Wars, famines, displacement, political and economic upheaval have led us to experience and face other conditions. More and more often we have been forced to attempt crossing the border and travelling across the world to find our home elsewhere and be welcomed. Yet, these circumstances challenge our social structures and us as human beings, resulting in racial or cultural divisions, discrimination and segregation, most visibly in the urban condition. Today, Detroit is an example of these forces within American cities. The segregation and the racial separation between black and white has affected and caused a decline in the economy of the world's auto-industrial city, never to be revived again. The welfare and the social system have collapsed. The disturbing images of the city are now getting further and further away from, are not even close to, what I used to hear was so called the American dream.",

Cameron was non-verbal throughout his early childhood, and at the time he could only communicate using drawings. This led him to study animation. 'Regeneration' was inspired from his train trip to London, where he witnessed a large crane looming over massive corporate buildings. This prompted him to create a cautionary sci-fi dystopian future London with Godzilla-like building monsters smashing each other and gentrifying historical buildings. This is what is currently happening in his rural town Farnham, after the film was completed. The film also has no dialogue which is normal to Cameron's work due to his childhood, he was inspired by silent yet visibly loud characters like Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin.\"",

      "description": "The idea was to make a film which is a visual form of the feeling of \u201Clooking in a dustbin\u201D, I really like the idea of how suddenly we find something interesting to look at even in the pile of trash, and if we manage to look closely the trash can tell a lot about people and the society, lot can be known about the people by going through their dustbins, so I took the idea of looking in a trash bin and tried to put it a social context. The images in the video represent the social and political situation in my country, so it is almost like looking in a public garbage bin and trying to figure out the political and social environment. I am planning to make a compilation of videos with the same idea like: Trash can of a Poet, Trash Can of a Government officer, Trash Can of a Shopping mall, Trash Can of a schizophrenic butcher, ect.https://www.theshowroom.org/relationships/parashar-naik I am an independent filmmaker based in a small town near MUMBAI, Maharashtra, INDIA, I started my art career as a visual artist (painter) and an art curator, I have exhibited my works in several countries and also curated art exhibitions (especially video exhibitions) Being a professional film editor, I have edited feature films like \u201CNAYA PATA\u201D, documentaries like \u201CLAMP UNDER THE BUSHEL\u201D, and many other projects.

A ritual for creating new worlds and situations for fragmented bodies, signals pass through the joints of animated and genderless bodies and body parts entangling the body-signal-actions both materially and conceptually as these control mechanisms interfere with pre-animated content. Perpetually shifting surfaces and skins serve as sites of projection and interference, contributing to the further \"queering\" of the state of these bodies and fragments that are stretched and submerged into and outside of the environment they inhabit, as they encounter desire, distress, and ritualized oscillations. Signals generate both sounds and compel movement, the making of the images, and the body further challenges the stability and integrity of the space in its otherworldliness and the spatial relationships it establishes with the audience. At the edge between crisis and satisfaction, the work adopts the role of Millet's own \"gleaners,\" making-do on the boundary between sustenance and the devoid.",

Only you can judge whether I succeed or not. Artist Statement: Desiring to discover gaps in general human theories about the surrounding world, I question them by investigating the errors and inaccuracies of human perception. The most familiar concepts such as time, space, physical laws and mathematical formulas, explaining them, inspire me to refute and test them. Likewise, human feelings, and relationships with others as well as with oneself, require rethinking, for they are in many respects imposed on a person by the society. In my search, I am my own starting point for checking the image of the world for strength. Expanding each studied aspect as widely as possible, I do not limit myself to material, technique or art form. Adhering to the principles of laconicism and clarity of the image, I share my revelations with the observers, in which I acknowledge the co-authors of the result.",

Bio: Julia & Clara are identical twins working as an artistic duo since 2016. They use a collaborative method to focus on the intertwined experiences that emerge from sharing an identical twinship. The practice is based on the specific position of the twin as a sought after study object in medical epidemiology. As a point of departure they use Gilles Deleuze\u2019s take on the dividual to examine the identical twin as a potential dividual in an individualist society. They accumulate material from social experiences, popular culture and scientific research. Medium used are text, 3D animation, video and video-installation. Their experiences are informed by the conflict that arises between an individualist society and the identical twin\u2019s lack of individuality, since twins share the same DNA. As a result they get disjoined as individuals, but at the same time clotted together. The effect is a dissolution of identity. Are identical twins really able to contain their own individualism?\"",
